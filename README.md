## Description

Nowadays, it is common to find programming games out there but they are mostly puzzle related. Puzzle games do require a certain level of intellect to indulge in. Hence, kids may not be attracted to the appeal of puzzle games. We want our game to feel more like an actual game where kids wouldnâ€™t mind spending hours and hours on it. 

Tower Programmer was a game designed to teach programming concepts while still remaining interactive. We hope that by using these visual elements, we are able to reduce the difficulty of learning programming by reducing the complexity of syntax and making it more readable to the user.

## How To Use

### Running the game

Go to **Git releases** and download the zip file on your system. Extract the folder and you should see a folder named Tower Programmer with a binary named TowerProgrammer.exe inside. Run the binary and you are good to go!

### For Developers
The source code for the game is available in the repository under the master branch. However, due to our inability to host the large binary files used in the game on github, we are unable to put the assets on git.

Please contact me at vencintgamer@gmail.com if you wish to have the assets.
